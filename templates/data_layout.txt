DATA/
├── raw/          <- immutable source drops (append-only)
├── processed/    <- cleaned / normalized data, reproducible from raw
├── prompts/      <- prompt experiments, AB tests, logs
├── outputs/      <- model responses, evals, artifacts with timestamps
├── cache/        <- cached LLM responses keyed by prompt+input+model hash
└── embeddings/   <- vector stores, metadata, index shards

Guidance:
1. Raw data is never mutated; rerun pipelines to regenerate processed outputs.
2. Every file under outputs/ includes timestamp, model, and prompt identifiers.
3. Cache entries must be easily purgeable and should not contain sensitive data.
4. Embeddings from different models or dimensions belong in separate subfolders.
