├── raw/          <- immutable source drops (append-only)
├── processed/    <- cleaned / normalized data, reproducible from raw
├── prompts/      <- prompt experiments, A/B tests, prompt logs
├── outputs/      <- model responses, evaluations, artifacts (timestamped)
├── cache/        <- cached LLM responses keyed by (prompt + input + model) hash
└── embeddings/   <- vector stores, metadata, indexes (versioned by model/dimension)

Guidance:
1. raw/ is never mutated; rerun pipelines to regenerate everything under processed/ and outputs/.
2. Every file under outputs/ includes, at minimum: timestamp, model identifier, and prompt identifier(s).
3. cache/ entries must be easily purgeable and must not contain sensitive data beyond what is already in raw/.
4. embeddings/ from different models or dimensions belong in clearly separated subfolders
	(e.g. embeddings/text-embedding-3-small/, embeddings/text-embedding-3-large/).
5. If experiments need one-off structures, prefer data/experiments/ under the relevant project
	rather than mixing experimental artifacts into raw/, processed/, or outputs/.
